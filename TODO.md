# Notes

From Talk with Ben Kerr and Mike Travisano.

* Mike: Growth slows down as the stuff gets bigger. This suggests that stuff in the middle is not getting enough to grow. Some kind of limitation on the growth rate.
* BenK: Time needs consideration. The constraints is that they must grow as much as possible in the time given.
* Mike: Tradeoff is linear between Growth and Settling? What was it? Select on size. 
* What is the growth rate: individual or cluster size?

# TODO

* Send animation to MT.
* Work on time.
* Do broken branches regrow? Need this option
* Implement some kind of selection.
* Split offs do not interfere with one another. So we need multiple spaces.

# LATER

* Speed-ups

# Done

* Cluster Distn
* Cell Death Implemented!
* Move to pymunk

# Ideas

* Try using a single revolution joint...
